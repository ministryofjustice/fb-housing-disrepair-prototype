Particularly if the problem is complex, or you and your landlord don't agree. \r\n\r\nYou may be able to share the cost of an expert opinion with your landlord, or claim the costs back if you win the case. \r\n\r\nFind out more about getting ready for court on the [Shelter website](https://england.shelter.org.uk/legal/housing_conditions/taking_action_on_disrepair/county_court_action/gathering_information)"
