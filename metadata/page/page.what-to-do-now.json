Particularly if the problem is complex, or you and your landlord don't agree. \r\n\r\nYou may be able to share the cost of an expert opinion with your landlord, or claim the costs back if you win the case. \r\n\r\nFor more information about getting a report from an expert, see \r\n\r\n- [The Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, Consultants Directory](http://www.ehn-online.com/consultantsdirectory/consultants.aspx?cdid=5548)\r\n- [The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors’ Find a Surveyor](https://www.ricsfirms.com/)\r\n- [The Expert Witness Directory (2015)](https://www.sweetandmaxwell.co.uk/our-businesses/directories.aspx)",
