This is likely to include:\r\n\r\n- proof of when the landlord was told about the problem and copies of any letters and emails\r\n- photographs of the problem \r\n- any evidence available from experts (eg surveyors, environmental health officers)\r\n- the tenancy agreement and other documents relating to the tenancy\r\n- any relevant medical reports detailing the effects of the bad housing conditions on the health or stress levels of the occupants\r\n- details of any costs incurred as a result of the disrepair.\r\n\r\n#### Getting an expert opinion ####\r\n\r\nYou may need to ask an expert to carry out an inspection and put together a report for the court. Particularly if the problem is complex, or you and your landlord don't agree. \r\n\r\nYou may be able to share the cost of an expert opinion with your landlord, or claim the costs back if you win the case. \r\n\r\nFor more information about getting a report from an expert, see \r\n\r\n- [The Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, Consultants Directory](http://www.ehn-online.com/consultantsdirectory/consultants.aspx?cdid=5548)\r\n- [The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors’ Find a Surveyor](https://www.ricsfirms.com/)\r\n- [The Expert Witness Directory (2015)](https://www.sweetandmaxwell.co.uk/our-businesses/directories.aspx)\r\n\r\nYou can also see the Shelter website for more about gathering information in preparation for a court case: [https://england.shelter.org.uk/legal/housing_conditions/taking_action_on_disrepair/county_court_action/gathering_information](https://england.shelter.org.uk/legal/housing_conditions/taking_action_on_disrepair/county_court_action/gathering_information).",
