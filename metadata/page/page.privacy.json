This page outlines your rights, and explains what we do with information collected through the feedback survey. \r\n\r\n## Why we are including a survey \r\nThis tool was created to provide people with support and signposting in relation to a housing disrepair issue. We want to make sure that as many people as possible have access to the help they need, and that the information we provide is useful. \r\n\r\nThe survey asks for your age, gender, ethnicity and disability status. This information will be used to explore whether experiences of the tool are better or worse for certain groups, and if worse, how the tool can be improved. All questions are optional. This survey is anonymous and no identifiable personal data is collected. \r\n\r\n## Who will have access to your data\r\n\r\nThe information you provide is managed and protected by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). \r\n\r\n## Sharing and storing your data\r\n\r\nAnonymised survey information may be kept for a maximum of 20 years for research purposes. After this point it will be transferred to the Departmental Library and Records Management Services (DLRMS) who will either dispose of it or transfer to the National Archives (www.nationalarchives.gov.uk) as relevant.\r\n\r\n### Contact us for more information about the survey or further research \r\nEmail: <housingdisrepairdata@justice.gov.uk>.\r\n"
