  "body": "## Taking legal action against your landlord or letting agent ##\r\n\r\nGoing to court can be expensive and time-consuming, but it is an option if you have not been able to resolve the problem in another way. You may want to talk to a solicitor or qualified legal professional before you start any legal action. \r\n\r\n#### Legal protection for tenants \r\n\r\n1. Check your tenancy agreement to see how you are covered. Your landlord should keep to the terms outlined in the agreement. \r\n\r\n2. There are a couple of laws protecting tenant's living conditions:\r\n\r\n- the [Fitness for Human Habitation Act 2018](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/homes-fitness-for-human-habitation-act-2018/guide-for-tenants-homes-fitness-for-human-habitation-act-2018)\r\n\r\n- the [Landlord and Tenant Act 1985](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/70)\r\n  \r\n## Making a claim\r\n\r\nYou need to send an official letter of claim to start the legal process. There are certain things that must be included: \r\n\r\n- your name and contact details\r\n- the address of the property\r\n- details of the problems. Be as specific as you can. \r\n- what you told your landlord and when you told them. Include all the dates. \r\n- how the problem is affecting you. For example if it is affecting your health. \r\n- how you want the problem to be fixed and details of compensation (if this applies to you)  \r\n\r\nYou can use one of the letter templates on the [Shelter website](https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/downloads_and_tools/sample_letters) \r\n\r\n## Give your landlord time to reply ##\r\n\r\nYou should give the landlord 20 days to reply and put things right. If they don't do so, you can the proceed with making a claim. \r\n\r\nRead more about taking legal action on the [Shelter website](https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/repairs/legal_action_if_your_landlord_wont_do_repairs) and the [Citizens Advice website](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/housing/renting-privately/during-your-tenancy/going-to-court-if-your-landlord-wont-do-repairs/).\r\n\r\nThe full process of making a claim is detailed in the [Pre-Action Protocol for Housing Conditions Claims in England](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/protocol/prot_hou)\r\n",
