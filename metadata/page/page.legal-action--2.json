  "body": "## Taking legal action against your landlord or letting agent ##\r\n\r\nGoing to court can be expensive and time-consuming, but it is an option if you have not been able to resolve the problem in another way. You may want to talk to a solicitor or qualified legal professional before you start any legal action. \r\n\r\nThere is a process you need to follow to make a claim. You can read the more about the law that protects tenants' living conditions on [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/homes-fitness-for-human-habitation-act-2018/guide-for-tenants-homes-fitness-for-human-habitation-act-2018)\r\n\r\n## Send an official letter of claim ##\r\n\r\nYou need to send an official letter of claim to start the legal process. There are certain things that must be included: \r\n\r\n- your name and contact details\r\n- the address of the property\r\n- details of the problems. Be as specific as you can. \r\n- what you told your landlord and when you told them. Include all the dates. \r\n- how the problem is affecting you. For example if it is affecting your health. \r\n- how you want the problem to be fixed and details of compensation (if this applies to you)  \r\n\r\nYou can use this template for your letter: XXX\r\n\r\n## Give your landlord time to reply ##\r\n\r\nYou should give the landlord 20 days to reply and put things right. If they don't do so, you can the proceed with making a claim. \r\n\r\nRead more about taking legal action on the [Shelter website](https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/repairs/legal_action_if_your_landlord_wont_do_repairs) and the [Citizens Advice website](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/housing/renting-privately/during-your-tenancy/going-to-court-if-your-landlord-wont-do-repairs/).\r\n\r\n## Consider making a 'small claim' ##\r\nYour claim could be heard in the small claims court. You'd only have to pay a fixed fee and you may not need a solicitor to represent you. \r\n\r\nFor claims where the only claim is for compensation (damages), the small claims limit of £10,000 applies. However, if a claim includes an application for an order for repair work it will only be allocated to the small claims track if both the:\r\n\r\n- estimated damages are less than £1,000, and\r\n- estimated cost of the repair work is less than £1,000.\r\n\r\nIf either amount is expected to be more than £1,000, you probably won't be able to take your case to the small claims court. \r\n\r\nSee the Shelter website for more information: [https://england.shelter.org.uk/legal/housing_conditions/taking_action_on_disrepair/county_court_action/gathering_information](https://england.shelter.org.uk/legal/housing_conditions/taking_action_on_disrepair/county_court_action/gathering_information).",
